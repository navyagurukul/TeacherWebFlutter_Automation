"""Resolve the school's enrolment figures — the Registered / Remaining counts
the home dashboard shows on its school-summary card.

The daily report carries these so each Slack summary says how many student seats
the QA school has taken and how many are still open, matching the Android
suite's report. Resolution order (first hit wins), most-faithful first:

1. `reports/school_enrolment.txt` — the counts read live off the home dashboard
   during this run (written by tests/test_navigation.py). This is literally what
   the portal displayed.
2. The API: `management/v1/schools/<id>/` -> `total_registered_students` and
   `total_strength`, the same payload the card is built from. Used when the UI
   run was skipped, so the figures still land in the report.

`remaining` is derived from the API exactly as the app derives it —
`total_strength - total_registered_students`, floored at zero.
